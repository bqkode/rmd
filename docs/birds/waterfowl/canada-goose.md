# Canada Goose

*Branta canadensis*

The Canada Goose is a large, familiar waterfowl known for its V-formation migration flights and distinctive honking calls.

## Physical Description

- **Length**: 75-110 cm (30-43 inches)
- **Wingspan**: 1.3-1.7 m (4.2-5.6 feet)
- **Weight**: 2.6-6.5 kg (5.7-14.3 lbs)

> **Did you know?** There are 7 recognized subspecies ranging from the tiny Cackling Goose (1.4 kg) to the Giant Canada Goose (6.5 kg).

## Habitat

Canada Geese are highly adaptable:

| Habitat Type | Season |
|--------------|--------|
| Arctic tundra | Breeding |
| Prairie wetlands | Breeding/Migration |
| Urban parks | Year-round |
| Golf courses | Year-round |
| Agricultural fields | Migration/Winter |

## Diet

Primarily herbivorous:

### Natural Foods
- Aquatic vegetation
- Grasses and sedges
- Berries
- Seeds

### Agricultural Foods
- Corn
- Wheat
- Soybeans
- Barley

```
Daily intake: 0.5-1.0 kg of vegetation
Grazing hours: 12+ per day during peak feeding
```

## Vocalizations

### Common Calls

1. **Honk**: Contact call, given in flight
2. **Hink**: Higher-pitched alarm
3. **Greeting**: Rapid, excited honking when reuniting
4. **Hiss**: Defensive threat display

## Migration

### V-Formation Flight

Benefits of flying in formation:
- Up to 70% energy savings
- Improved communication
- Visual contact with flock
- Leader rotation reduces fatigue

Migration distance: 2,000-3,000 km for northern populations

### Resident Populations

Many Canada Geese no longer migrate, remaining in urban and suburban areas year-round. These "resident" populations have exploded since the 1980s.

## Reproduction

Canada Geese mate for life:

- **Pair bond**: Forms at 2-3 years old
- **Nest**: On ground near water, made of plant material lined with down
- **Eggs**: 4-8 white eggs
- **Incubation**: 25-28 days
- **Fledging**: 6-9 weeks

### Family Life

```
Gosling development:
Day 1: Leave nest, can swim and feed
Week 1: Strong walkers, stay close to parents
Week 9: Flight feathers develop
Year 1: Stay with parents through first migration
Year 2-3: Find own mate
```

## Human Interactions

### Conflicts

- Aggressive behavior during nesting
- Droppings on lawns and beaches
- Crop damage
- Aircraft strike hazard

### Management

Non-lethal management includes:
- Habitat modification
- Egg addling
- Border collies
- Laser deterrents

## Conservation Status

**Status**: Least Concern

Population has increased dramatically from near-extinction in the early 1900s to over 7 million birds today.

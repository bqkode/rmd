Prefer areas with:
- Abundant aquatic vegetation
- Protected nesting sites
- Minimal current

### Aquatic Plants (80%)
- Pondweed
- Eelgrass
- Algae
- Water milfoil

### Terrestrial Plants (15%)
- Grasses
- Agricultural crops
- Leaves

### Animal Matter (5%)

```

- Dabbling: 0-50 cm
- Upending: 50-100 cm
- Bottom feeding: up to 1 m
```

Daily consumption: 3-4 kg of vegetation

## Behavior

### Why "Mute"?

Despite their name, Mute Swans are not silent. They produce:

- Hissing (threat display)
- Snorting
- Trumpeting (soft, infrequent)
- Throbbing wing beats ("singing")

They are called "mute" because they lack the loud, trumpeting calls of other swan species.

### Aggression

Mute Swans are notoriously territorial:

```
Aggressive displays:
├── Busking: Wings raised, neck back
├── Hissing: Bill open, tongue visible
├── Charging: Swimming rapidly at intruder
└── Wing beating: Can break bones
```

## Reproduction

Mute Swans form lifelong pair bonds:

### Courtship

The famous heart-shaped pose occurs when two swans face each other with necks curved, bills touching.

### Nesting

- **Nest**: Huge mound of vegetation (1-2 m diameter)
- **Eggs**: 4-8 pale green eggs
- **Incubation**: 35-41 days
- **Fledging**: 120-150 days

### Parental Care

Both parents:
- Defend territory
- Build and maintain nest
- Incubate eggs (female primarily)
- Protect cygnets
- Allow cygnets to ride on their backs

## Cultural Significance

- Symbol of love and fidelity
- Featured in ballet (*Swan Lake*)
- Traditional food for royalty
- All swans in England belong to the Crown

## Conservation Status

**Status**: Least Concern (globally)

### Concerns

- Invasive in North America
- Displaces native waterfowl
- Damages aquatic vegetation
- Aggressive to other wildlife

Native populations in Europe are stable.

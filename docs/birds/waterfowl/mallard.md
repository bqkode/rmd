# Mallard

*Anas platyrhynchos*

The Mallard is the most abundant and widespread dabbling duck in the world, and the ancestor of most domestic duck breeds.

## Physical Description

- **Length**: 50-65 cm (20-26 inches)
- **Wingspan**: 81-98 cm (32-39 inches)
- **Weight**: 0.7-1.6 kg (1.5-3.5 lbs)

### Sexual Dimorphism

| Feature | Male (Drake) | Female (Hen) |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Head | Iridescent green | Mottled brown |
| Breast | Chestnut | Mottled brown |
| Bill | Yellow | Orange with dark markings |
| Tail | Black curl | Brown |

Both sexes have:
- Blue speculum (wing patch) bordered by white
- Orange legs and feet

## Habitat

Found in almost any wetland:

1. Ponds and lakes
2. Rivers and streams
3. Marshes
4. Coastal estuaries
5. Urban parks
6. Agricultural fields

## Diet

Mallards are omnivorous dabbling ducks:

### Feeding Techniques

- **Dabbling**: Tipping up to reach underwater vegetation
- **Grazing**: Feeding on land vegetation
- **Filter feeding**: Straining small invertebrates from water

### Food Items

```
Plant matter (90% in fall/winter):
├── Seeds
├── Stems
├── Roots
└── Agricultural grains

Animal matter (40% in breeding season):
├── Insects
├── Snails
├── Worms
└── Small fish
```

## Vocalizations

> The classic "quack" is made only by females. Males produce a softer, raspy "rahb."

| Call | Sex | Context |
|------|-----|---------|
| Quack | Female | Contact, alarm |
| Rahb | Male | Courtship |
| Whistle | Male | Courtship |
| Peeping | Both | Ducklings |

## Reproduction

### Courtship

Males perform elaborate displays:

1. **Head-throw**: Bill pointed skyward
2. **Grunt-whistle**: Head dip with vocalization
3. **Down-up**: Body lifts showing speculum
4. **Nod-swimming**: Rapid head bobbing

### Nesting

- **Nest**: Ground nest lined with down
- **Eggs**: 8-13 cream-colored eggs
- **Incubation**: 23-30 days (female only)
- **Fledging**: 50-60 days

Ducklings are precocial—they leave the nest within 24 hours and can feed themselves immediately.

## Domestication

Mallards were domesticated about 2,000 years ago in China. Domestic breeds include:

- Pekin (white, raised for meat)
- Khaki Campbell (prolific egg layer)
- Indian Runner (upright posture)
- Cayuga (iridescent black-green)

## Conservation Status

**Status**: Least Concern

Global population estimated at 19 million birds. One of the most hunted waterfowl species worldwide.

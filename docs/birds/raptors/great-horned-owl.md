# Great Horned Owl

*Bubo virginianus*

The Great Horned Owl is a powerful nocturnal predator known as the "tiger of the sky" due to its fierce hunting abilities.

## Physical Description

- **Length**: 46-63 cm (18-25 inches)
- **Wingspan**: 1.0-1.5 m (3.3-4.9 feet)
- **Weight**: 0.9-2.5 kg (2-5.5 lbs)

### Distinctive Features

- Large ear tufts ("horns")
- Yellow eyes
- White throat patch
- Heavily barred underparts
- Large, powerful talons

> **Note**: The ear tufts are not ears! Real ears are hidden on sides of head, asymmetrically placed for precise sound localization.

## Habitat

Most adaptable owl in the Americas:

1. Forests (deciduous, coniferous, mixed)
2. Deserts
3. Swamps
4. Urban parks and suburbs
5. Arctic treeline
6. Tropical rainforests

## Diet

Great Horned Owls eat almost anything they can catch:

| Prey Type | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Mammals | Rabbits, skunks, cats, porcupines |
| Birds | Ducks, hawks, other owls |
| Reptiles | Snakes, lizards, turtles |
| Amphibians | Frogs, salamanders |
| Invertebrates | Scorpions, crayfish |

### Notable Prey

- One of few predators of skunks (poor sense of smell)
- Will attack porcupines (often found with quills)
- Kills other raptors including Barred Owls and Red-tailed Hawks

## Hunting Adaptations

### Silent Flight

Special feather adaptations allow virtually silent flight:

```
Noise-reducing features:
├── Leading edge: Comb-like serrations
├── Trailing edge: Frayed feathers
└── Surface: Soft, velvety texture
```

### Vision

- Eyes fixed in sockets (must turn head)
- Can rotate head 270 degrees
- Excellent night vision (100x better than humans)
- See in near-complete darkness

### Hearing

- Can locate prey by sound alone
- Asymmetrical ear placement
- Facial disk funnels sound to ears

## Vocalizations

Classic owl hoot:

```
Male: hoo-hoo-hoo-HOO-hoo
Female: hoo-hoo-hoo-HOO-hoo-hoo (higher, more notes)
```

Also produces screams, barks, hisses, and bill clacking.

## Reproduction

Great Horned Owls nest earlier than most birds:

- **Courtship**: October-December
- **Egg-laying**: January-February
- **Incubation**: 30-37 days
- **Fledging**: 9-10 weeks
- **Independence**: Fall

They don't build nests—use abandoned hawk, crow, or squirrel nests.

## Conservation Status

**Status**: Least Concern

Stable population across range. Highly adaptable to human-modified environments.

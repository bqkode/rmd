# House Finch

*Haemorhous mexicanus*

The House Finch is a small, social songbird with a cheerful warbling song, commonly found at backyard feeders.

## Physical Description

- **Wingspan**: 20-25 cm (8-10 inches)
- **Weight**: 16-27 g (0.6-1.0 oz)

### Coloration

Males display variable red coloration on their head, breast, and rump. The intensity depends on diet during molt—carotenoid-rich foods produce brighter reds.

Females and juveniles are brown-streaked without red coloring.

- Old nests of other birds
- Traffic lights and signs

## Song
